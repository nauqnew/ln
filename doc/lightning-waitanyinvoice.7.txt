===========================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
lightning-waitanyinvoice - Protocol for waiting for payments.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*waitanyinvoice* ['lastlabel']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *waitanyinvoice* RPC command waits until an invoice is paid, then
returns a single entry as per *listinvoice*.  It will not return for
any invoices paid prior to or including 'lastlabel'.

This is usually called iteratively: once with no arguments, then
repeatedly with the returned 'label' entry.  This ensures that no paid
invoice is missed.

RETURN VALUE
------------
On success, the 'rhash', 'label', and 'msatoshi' will be returned.

//FIXME:Enumerate errors
